## Overview

This library is a Infrastructure as Code tool for PostgreSQL databases, similar to Terraform but specifically designed for database schema management.

You have a single schema.sql file that contains the state you want to be in. This tool will figure out what needs to be changed in the target database for the target database to be in the same state.

This means this tool will figure out what diffs to apply to the target database, like adding/updating/deleting various schema changes to the target postgres database.

## Other

- Use bun as package manager, not npm.
- Use only TypeScript files, not JavaScript files.
