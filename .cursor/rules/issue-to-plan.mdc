For the given overview.md file, create a plan.md alongside the file where you add an actionable task list of how you plan to imeplement the things defined in the overview file.

Ensure that the tasks are in the order of how they should be implemented and should be completed from top to bottom.

Add different phases like categories so we can ask the ai to implement one "phase" at a time. Each phase should be a set of tasks that are related to each other.
